# Local LLM Chat Provider Fork

## Product Direction

This repository is an independent continuation of the original llama.cpp chat
provider. Its goal is one efficient VS Code Chat integration for local
OpenAI-compatible servers and DeepSeek, without switching a single global URL
back and forth.

Compatibility identifiers remain under `llamacpp.*` so existing settings,
commands, and model selections continue to work. User-facing ownership,
repository metadata, documentation, and release artifacts belong to the fork.

## Major Changes

### Multiple Model Sources

- Local and DeepSeek models are discovered and advertised at the same time.
- Source-prefixed internal ids route each request to the correct endpoint and
  are removed before the upstream API call.
- Local and DeepSeek API keys are stored separately in VS Code SecretStorage.
- Local runtime context is detected from server metadata with configurable
  fallbacks.

### Direct API Profiles

- Requests go directly from the extension to the selected OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint; there is no intermediate model proxy.
- llama.cpp receives compatible prompt-cache, reasoning, sampling, and tool
  fields.
- Normal local and DeepSeek output defaults are separate from the global hard
  ceiling, avoiding oversized reservation on ordinary turns.
- DeepSeek receives its own thinking and reasoning profile and never receives
  llama.cpp-only `cache_prompt`.
- Tool-result and tool-call compatibility retries are bounded and logged.

### Context And Long Conversations

- Soft and hard context budgets account for messages, tool schemas, and reply
  reserve.
- Old history is compacted before overflow; one stricter retry is available
  when the server still rejects the request.
- Large tool results can be sanitized, summarized, and capped before they
  consume the context window.
- Exact streamed token usage is forwarded to Copilot Session Info when the
  server provides it; a local estimate is used otherwise.
- Local preflight budgeting uses llama.cpp's real chat template and tokenizer,
  with cached fallback-safe `/apply-template` and `/tokenize` requests.
- Compaction retains bounded tool names, safe arguments, paths, statuses,
  diagnostics, and JSON structure instead of dropping old tool results entirely.
- Compaction keeps complete user turns, preserves code/decision milestones, and
  records its own duration separately from exact tokenizer preflight latency.
- llama.cpp and DeepSeek cache-hit counters are normalized and shown in Quick
  Access diagnostics.

### Reasoning And Streaming

- Native reasoning fields and `<think>` blocks are separated from visible
  answer text.
- Qwen 3.6 can preserve historical reasoning across multi-step tool turns, and
  effective reasoning kwargs are included in sanitized request diagnostics.
- Small text chunks are coalesced to reduce UI update pressure during long
  answers; progressively longer answers use a lower render cadence.
- Cancelling a turn actively cancels the response body so an abandoned
  generation cannot keep the only local server slot busy after VS Code has
  released its request queue lease.
- Empty output and repeated tool-only turns have bounded recovery paths.
- Network failures and HTTP 429/502/503/504 responses have cancellation-aware
  pre-stream exponential backoff; timeouts and arbitrary client errors do not.
- An optional Copilot Chat patch exposes native Thinking Effort and the real
  model output limit. See [Copilot Chat Integration](COPILOT_PATCH.md).

### Shared Memory

- Durable memory is stored once in extension global storage and is shared by
  local models, DeepSeek, workspaces, and chats in the same VS Code profile.
- Relevant entries are injected near the latest user turn within a separate
  token budget, preserving the reusable prompt prefix.
- Agent tools can store, search, and delete entries with confirmation for
  mutating operations.
- The JSON store remains inspectable and editable by the user.

### Diagnostics And Quick Access

- Structured JSONL logs record routing, attempts, timings, context budgets,
  token usage source, retries, and tool names without API keys or raw prompts.
- Raw stream chunk logging is separately disabled by default because it is
  verbose and can expose model output.
- Quick Access groups model actions, endpoints, generation settings, memory,
  diagnostics, and live status instead of presenting one long flat list.

### Repository Cleanup

- Publisher and repository metadata now point to `MrLordCat`.
- Dead provider code, duplicate API declarations, runtime logs, and automatic
  postinstall downloads were removed.
- Context arithmetic, memory, reasoning, constants, and Quick Access were split
  into focused modules with tests.
- Architecture, audit, memory, Copilot integration, and fork behavior are now
  documented under `docs/`.
