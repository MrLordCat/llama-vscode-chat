# Reliability And Diagnostics

## Tool-Call Guard

The provider validates every streamed tool call against the exact catalog sent
in that request before creating a VS Code `LanguageModelToolCallPart`.

Deterministic repairs are deliberately narrow:

- remove an outer `json` code fence;
- extract one balanced JSON object from surrounding text;
- remove trailing commas outside strings;
- match an advertised tool name by case and remove outer backticks.

The guard does not invent required arguments, coerce types, rename properties,
or select a different tool. It checks required fields, primitive and array
types, enums, `anyOf`, item schemas, and `additionalProperties: false`. Unknown
tools and invalid arguments are rejected before execution.

When a rejection occurs before visible text or an executable tool part has
been emitted, the provider may retry the model with a short correction message.
`llamacpp.toolCallRepairMaxAttempts` bounds this path to at most two attempts;
the default is one. Correction messages are appended near the mutable end of
history so the stable cache prefix is retained.

Loop protection canonicalizes historical assistant tool calls and detects only
consecutive identical name/argument signatures. At the configured threshold it
adds a guard requiring the model to use the existing result, inspect an error,
change approach, or state the blocker. It does not silently suppress execution.

Relevant settings:

```json
{
  "llamacpp.toolCallRepairEnabled": true,
  "llamacpp.validateToolCallSchema": true,
  "llamacpp.toolCallRepairMaxAttempts": 1,
  "llamacpp.toolLoopProtection": true,
  "llamacpp.toolLoopDetectionThreshold": 3
}
```

## Provider Health Check

Run `Local LLM: Run Provider Health Check` from the Command Palette or Quick
Access. It performs read-only, non-generating checks:

- model discovery for each configured source;
- local llama.cpp runtime context from `/slots`;
- exact local prompt counting through `/apply-template` and `/tokenize`;
- local `cache_prompt`, API Direct, knowledge policy, memory, schema validation,
  repair, and loop-protection settings;
- DeepSeek cache/tokenizer expectations;
- warning for retired `deepseek-chat` and `deepseek-reasoner` aliases.

The report is written as Markdown and JSON under
`<globalStorage>/reports/` and the Markdown file opens automatically. `FAIL`
means a source is not currently usable, `WARN` means a fallback or risky
configuration is active, and `INFO` records expected provider-specific behavior.

## Session Quality Report

Run `Local LLM: Open Session Quality Report` to export metrics accumulated
since extension activation or the last reset:

- prompt and cached prompt tokens with weighted cache-hit percentage;
- first-token latency and generation throughput;
- tool calls, deterministic repairs, rejections, and correction retries;
- detected tool loops;
- provider compaction and context-overflow retries;
- per-turn model id and context estimate.

Reports contain metrics and model ids only. They do not retain message or tool
result bodies. Use `Local LLM: Reset Session Metrics` before a controlled test.

## Repeatable Agent Benchmark

1. Reload VS Code after installing the VSIX.
2. Run the provider health check and keep the generated report.
3. Reset session metrics.
4. Start a new chat, select the same model and Thinking Effort used for the
   baseline, and submit the exact same audit prompt.
5. Let the agent finish without manually compacting or changing models.
6. Export the session quality report.
7. Compare evidence quality and task completion together with cache hit rate,
   first-token latency, tool retries/rejections, tool loops, compaction, and
   overflow recovery.

A better answer with bounded additional tool work is a useful improvement. A
longer answer or more tool calls alone is not.
